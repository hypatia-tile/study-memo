= Getting started with Bootstrap in Angular

You need to include the Bootstrap library and apply its classes in your components.
Here's a brief guid:

. Install Bootstrap via npm: +
Run the following command in your project directory to install Bootstrap:
+
[source, bash]
----
npm install bootstrap
----
. Include Bootstrap in `angular.json`: +
Add the Bootstrap CSS file to the `styles`` array in the `angular.json` file:
+
[source, json]
----
"styles": [
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "src/styles.css"
]
----
. Use Bootstrap classes in your component: +
In your `testPage.component.css`, you don't need to write custom styles initially.
Instead, you can use Bootstrap classes direectly in your HTML template.
For example:
+
[source, html]
----
<div>
    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Bootstrap</h1>
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
</div>
----
This approach allows you to leverage Bootstrap's pre-defined styles and components without writing custom CSS.
