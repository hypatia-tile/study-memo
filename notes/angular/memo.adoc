== router-outlet

In Angular, `router-outlet` is a `directive`
provided by the Angular Router module.
It acts as a placeholder in your application
where the routed components are dynamically loaded based on the current route configuration.

Key Points About `router-outlet`:

. Dynamic Component Loading: +
It renders the component associated with the `activeRoute`.
. Routing Configuration: +
The routes are defined in a routing module (e.g., `app-routing.ts`),
and the `router-outlet` displays the component for the matched route.
. Multiple Outlets: +
You can have multiple `router-outlet` directives
in your application,
each with a unique name for advanced routing scenarios.
