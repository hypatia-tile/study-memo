== Overview

MacTeX is a TeX distribution for macOS that includes TeX Live, LaTeX, Ghostscript, and related tools.

== Installation

=== 1. Download MacTeX

Download the latest version from the official site:

link:https://www.tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html[MacTeX Download Page]

Requirements:

- macOS 10.14 or later (Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey, Ventura, Sonoma, Sequoia)
- Native support for both Apple Silicon (ARM) and Intel chips
- Installer is developer-signed and notarized by Apple

=== 2. Install the Package

. Move `MacTeX.pkg` to your desktop or another convenient location.
. Double-click the file and follow the on-screen instructions.

.Optional: Skip Ghostscript
If you are using Ghostscript via MacPorts or Homebrew, you may want to skip installing it again:

- Choose "Customize" during installation
- Uncheck the Ghostscript option

=== 3. Confirm Installation

After installation, confirm that `pdflatex` and other binaries are available:

[source,shell]
----
which pdflatex
pdflatex --version
----

== Setting Up PATH (if needed)

MacTeX installs binaries in `/Library/TeX/texbin`.

If it's not in your shell's PATH, add the following to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile`:

[source,shell]
----
export PATH="/Library/TeX/texbin:$PATH"
----

Apply changes:

[source,shell]
----
source ~/.zshrc
----

== Writing and Compiling LaTeX

Create a basic file `hello.tex`:

[source,latex]
----
\documentclass{article}
\begin{document}
Hello, \LaTeX!
\end{document}
----

Compile it:

[source,shell]
----
pdflatex hello.tex
----

This produces `hello.pdf`.

== Tips and Tools

- For editing, consider using:
  * VS Code with LaTeX Workshop extension
  * TeXShop (bundled with MacTeX)
  * Overleaf (web-based)

- Use `latexmk` for automatic compilation.

[source,shell]
----
latexmk -pdf hello.tex
----
