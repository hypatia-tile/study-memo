= Executable Inspection Tools
:toc:
:icons: font

This memo shows how to inspect a compiled executable (e.g., `a.out`) using common command-line tools.

== Tools

=== 1. `nm`

Lists symbol names (functions, variables, etc.) in the binary:

[source,shell]
----
nm a.out
----

=== 2. `strings`

Extracts printable strings (useful for finding hardcoded values):

[source,shell]
----
strings a.out
----

=== 3. `objdump`

Displays detailed binary information, including disassembly:

[source,shell]
----
objdump -xD --demangle a.out
----

Options:
- `-x`: All headers
- `-D`: Disassemble all sections
- `--demangle`: Convert C++ mangled names into readable format

== Notes

- These commands are especially useful when debugging or reverse-engineering a binary.
- Combine them with `file` and `readelf` for deeper ELF inspection on Linux systems.

== References

- `man nm`, `man strings`, `man objdump`
