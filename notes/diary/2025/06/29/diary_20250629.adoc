== Symbolic Computation

We can use symbolic computation to manipulate mathematical expressions and equations.

**Symbolic Computation** (also known as computer algebra) is a scientific area
that focuses on the development of algorithm and software
for manipulating mathematical expressions and other mathemetical objects symbolically.
It involve representing and processing mathematical formulas and expressions as symbolic entities
rather than numerical approximations.


== Proxy

A **proxy** in networking is a server that act as an intermediary
between user's device and the internet.
It handles requests on the user's behalf.
It essentially act as a middleman, masking the user's IP address
and potentially enhancing privacy, security, and access to restricted content.

A **reverse proxy** acts as an intermediary,
intercepting client request and forwarding them to one or more backend servers.
It enhances security, performance, and reliability of web applications
by handling task like load balancing, caching, and SSL termination.
