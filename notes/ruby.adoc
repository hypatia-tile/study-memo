== Overview

This guide covers how to install Ruby on macOS using Homebrew, configure your shell, and run a basic Ruby program.

== Prerequisites

* macOS with Homebrew installed
* Terminal access (preferably zsh)

== Installation Steps

=== 1. Install Ruby via Homebrew

[source,shell]
----
brew install ruby
----

This installs the latest version of Ruby and places it under Homebrewâ€™s managed directory.

=== 2. Update Your PATH

To make the Homebrew version of Ruby available system-wide, add the following to your shell profile (e.g., `~/.zshrc`):

[source,zsh]
----
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
----

Then apply the changes:

[source,shell]
----
source ~/.zshrc
----

Confirm the Ruby version:

[source,shell]
----
ruby -v
----

== Write and Run Your First Ruby Program

Create a new file `hello.rb`:

[source,ruby]
----
puts "Hello, Ruby!"
----

Run it:

[source,shell]
----
ruby hello.rb
----

== Digression: What Is Homebrew?

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS. It simplifies software installation and ensures consistency.
