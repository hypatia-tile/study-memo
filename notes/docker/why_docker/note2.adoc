= What does mean that Docker containers run reliably across environments?

== what does "run reliably across environments" mean?

In software development, "environments" are the different setups
where your application might run.
For example:

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Environment
| Description

| Local
| Your own laptop or development machine

| Staging
| A test esrver that mimics production

| Production
| The live server where users access the app

| CI/CD
| A pipeline server running tests/builds automatically

|===

== The problem without Docker

=== Imagine you wrote a Python application that depends on:

* Python 3.10
* A certain version of Numpy
* Some system libraries

=== Now imagine:

* Your team member has Python 3.8, a different Numpy version.
* The staging server runs Linux, but you developed on macOS.
* In production, the required library isn't even installed.

=== This leads to:

* "It works on my machine!"
* Bugs that appear only in production
* Time wasted debugging mismatches

== How Docker Solves This

Docker put **everything your app needs** into a single container image:

* The correct version of Python
* Your code
* All dependencies
* Even environment variables and config files

That image will behave the same whether it's running on:

* Your MacBook
* A Linux staging server
* A Windows CI/CD pipeline

Because Docker abstracts away the host OS differences,
the app lives its own portable environment.

== So "across environments" means:

* Across operating systems
* Across team members' machines
* Across servers (staging, production)
* Across cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP)

If you'd like, I can show an example where code fails on one environment but succeeds inside Docker -would that help illustrate it?
