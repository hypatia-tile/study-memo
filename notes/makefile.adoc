== Example 1: Compile C Files into `bin/`

The following Makefile rule compiles all `.c` files in the `experiments/` directory and outputs executables to the `bin/` directory.

[source,makefile]
----
EXPERIMENT_DIR := experiments

experiments:
	@mkdir -p bin
	@for file in $(wildcard $(EXPERIMENT_DIR)/*.c); do \
		name=$$(basename $$file .c); \
		echo "Compiling $$file -> bin/$$name"; \
		gcc -o bin/$$name $$file; \
	done
----

== Explanation

. **Create `bin/` directory**
+
Ensures the output directory exists before compilation:

[source,makefile]
----
@mkdir -p bin
----

. **Loop over `.c` files**
+
This loop processes all C files in the `experiments` folder:

[source,makefile]
----
@for file in $(wildcard $(EXPERIMENT_DIR)/*.c); do ...
----

. **Extract base filename (no extension)**
+
The name of the file without `.c` is stored as `name`:

[source,makefile]
----
name=$$(basename $$file .c)
----

. **Compile each file**
+
Compile using `gcc`, placing the output in `bin/`:

[source,makefile]
----
gcc -o bin/$$name $$file
----

. **Suppress command output**
+
The `@` symbol suppresses the echoing of shell commands for cleaner output.

== Notes

- Always double the dollar signs (`$$`) when using shell variables in Makefile.
- Use `wildcard` to gather files dynamically.
- This rule assumes `gcc` is available and your `.c` files do not depend on headers outside their directory.
