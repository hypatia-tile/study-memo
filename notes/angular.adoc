* [ ] Use the custom directive in a component

== Angular Memo

=== `router-outlet`

In Angular, `router-outlet` is a built-in directive provided by the Angular Router module. It serves as a **placeholder** in the HTML where routed components are dynamically inserted.

==== Key Points

. **Dynamic Component Loading**
+
The component matched to the current route is rendered at the location of `router-outlet`.

. **Route Configuration**
+
Routes are defined in the routing module (e.g., `app-routing.module.ts`):

[source,typescript]
----
const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent },
  { path: 'about', component: AboutComponent },
];
----

These routes determine what gets rendered in the `router-outlet`.

. **Multiple Outlets**
+
You can have multiple named outlets:

[source,html]
----
<router-outlet name="sidebar"></router-outlet>
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
----

This allows different parts of the screen to show different components based on routing configuration.

. **Usage**
+
Place `<router-outlet></router-outlet>` in the main application layout (`app.component.html`) to enable routing.

=== What Is a Directive?

A directive is a class annotated with the `@Directive()` decorator. There are three main types:

1. **Component directives** (created using `@Component`)
2. **Attribute directives** (modify behavior or appearance, like `ngClass`, `ngStyle`)
3. **Structural directives** (change DOM structure, like `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`)

==== Example: Attribute Directive

[source,typescript]
====
@Directive({
  selector: '[appHighlight]'
})
export class HighlightDirective {
  constructor(el: ElementRef) {
    el.nativeElement.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
  }
}
====
Use it in HTML:

[source,html]
====
<p appHighlight>This is highlighted!</p>
====
