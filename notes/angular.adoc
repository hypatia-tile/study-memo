=== router-outlet

In Angular, `router-outlet` is a `directive`
provided by the Angular Router module.
It acts as a placeholder in your application
where the routed components are dynamically loaded based on the current route configuration.

Key Points About `router-outlet`:

. Dynamic Component Loading: +
It renders the component associated with the `activeRoute`.
. Routing Configuration: +
The routes are defined in a routing module (e.g., `app-routing.ts`),
and the `router-outlet` displays the component for the matched route.
. Multiple Outlets: +
You can have multiple `router-outlet` directives
in your application,
each with a unique name for advanced routing scenarios.

. app.routes.ts:
** This file defines the route configurations for your application.
** Example:
+
[source, typescript]
---
import { Routes } from '@angular/router';
import { TestPageComponent } from './test-page/test-page.component';

export const routes: Routes = [
    { path: 'test-page', component: TestPageComponent }
];
---
. app.component.html:
** Contains the `router-outlet` directive where routed components are displayed.
** Example:
+
[source, html]
---
<router-outlet></router-outlet>
---
. app.component.ts:
** The root component of your application,
which includes the `RouterOutlet` in its `imports` array
if using standalone components.
** Example:
+
[source, typescript]
----
import { RouterOutlet } from '@angular/router';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-root',
    standalone: true,
    imports: [RouterOutlet],
    templateUrl: './app.component.html',
    styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']
})
export class AppComponent {
    title = 'my-angular-app';
}
----
. index.html:
** The entry of your application, which contains the `<app-root></app-root>` tag.
where the Angular app is bootstrapped.
** Example:
+
[source, html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

== Getting started with Bootstrap in Angular

You need to include the Bootstrap library and apply its classes in your components.
Here's a brief guid:

. Install Bootstrap via npm: +
Run the following command in your project directory to install Bootstrap:
+
[source, bash]
----
npm install bootstrap
----
. Include Bootstrap in `angular.json`: +
Add the Bootstrap CSS file to the `styles`` array in the `angular.json` file:
+
[source, json]
----
"styles": [
    "node_modules/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css",
    "src/styles.css"
]
----
. Use Bootstrap classes in your component: +
In your `testPage.component.css`, you don't need to write custom styles initially.
Instead, you can use Bootstrap classes direectly in your HTML template.
For example:
+
[source, html]
----
<div>
    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Bootstrap</h1>
    <button class="btn btn-primary">Click Me</button>
</div>
----
This approach allows you to leverage Bootstrap's pre-defined styles and components without writing custom CSS.

== `*ngFor` Directive

=== If `*ngFor` is not working

If `*ngFor` is not working in your Angular project,
here are some common issues and theri solutions:

. Missing `CommonModule`: +
The `*ngFor` directive is part of the `CommonModule`.
if you are using standalone components,
ensure that `CommonModule` is imported in your component.
+
.Solution: Update your `TestPageComponent` to import `CommonModule`: +
[source, typescript]
----
import { Component, ViewEncapsulation } from '@angular/core';
import { CommonModule } from '@angular/common';
...
