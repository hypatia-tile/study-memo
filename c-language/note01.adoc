- link:note01_1.adoc[Benefits of using Docker for Learning C]

== Example: Simple C Development Docker Setup

Here's a minimal `Dockerfile` to get you started:
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM gcc:latest

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

CMD [ "bash" ]
----

And then:
[source, bash]
----
docker build -t c-dev .
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/app c-dev
----

You'll be inside a container where you can compile and run your C program, like:
[source, bash]
----
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
----
