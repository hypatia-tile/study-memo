= Benefits of Using Docker for Learning C

. Consistency Across Setups +
You get the same development environment every time
-- same compiler version, libraries, tools, etc.
No more "it works on my machine" issues.
. No need to install Dev Tools on Host +
You don't have to install compilers,
build tools, or libraries on your system.
Just pull a Docker image with everything pre-installed (like `gcc`, `make`, `valgrind`, etc.).
. Easy Experimentation +
You can mess around with defferent setups(e.g., various C standards like C89, C99, C11)
without worrying about breaking your main system.
. Version Control for Your Environment +
Your `Dockerfile` becomes a version-controlled recipe for your C dev environment
-- super useful for sharing or reusing later.
. Lightweight and Portable +
You can use your C dev environment on any machine with Docker installed
-- Windows, macOS, Linux -- without platrorm-specific issues.
