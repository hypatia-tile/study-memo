== What is an SSH key?

* An SSH key is a secure access credential used in the Secure Shell (SSH) protocol.

== What is `ssh-keygen`?

* The `ssh-keygen` command is used to generate an SSH key pair,
but it must be run manually unless your system or application explicitly call it.
(e.g., when setting up GitHub access or configuring SSH login for the first time)
