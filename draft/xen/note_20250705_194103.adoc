== Overview

* ** Xen project ** is a Linux Foundation project,
which brings the power of virtualization everywhere.

* Xen project is a global open source community
that develops the Xen project Hypervisor and its associated subprojects.

* Xen is an open source type-1 (bare-metal) hypervisor
which makes it possible to run many instances of an operating system or indeed
different operating systems in parallel on a single machine (or host).

* Xen is the only type-1 hypervisor that is available as open source.

* The Xen hypervisor is a thin layer of software
which **emulates a computer architecture**
allowing multiple operating systems to run simultaneously.

* The hypervisor is started by the bootloader of computer it is installed on.

== Mission of Xen Project

* The mission of the Xen Project is to advance virtualization technology
across a whole range of commercial and open source domains.

== What is Type-1, Type-2 Hypervisor?

* **Type-1 Hypervisor**: Also known as a bare-metal hypervisor,
which runs directly on the host's hardware,
managing virtual machines without needing a separate operating system.
* **Type-2 Hypervisor**: Also known as a hosted hypervisor,
which runs on top of a host operating system.

== What is emulation is computer architecture?

* **Emulation in computer architecture** refers to the ability of a system
to mimic the behavior of another system,
allowing software designed for one platform to run on different one.

=== Distinction from Virtualization

* While both emulation and virtualization create virtual environments,
virtualization focuses on partitioning resources of a physical machine,
whereas emulation aims to replicate the behavior of another system.
