== Overview

* **Emulation in computer architecture** essentially refers to creating a virtual environment
that replicates the target system's hardware and software,
enabling cross-platform compatibility and preserving legacy systems.

== More Details

=== Key Concepts

* Target System: (Guest) +
The system whose behavior is being emulated.
(e.g., a specific CPU architecture or operating system)
* Host System: (Host) +
The system that is running the emulation software.
(e.g., a modern computer with a different architecture)
* Emulation Software: (Emulator) +
The software that creates the virtual environment,
mimicking the target system's hardware and software.

=== How It Works

. Instruction Translation +
The emulator translates instructions from the target system's architecture
to the host system's architecture,
. Hardware Mimicking +
The emulator simulates the behavior of the target system's hardware components,
such as the CPU, memory, and peripherals.
. Software Compatibility +
By replicating the target system's environment,
the emulator allows software designed for that system to run on the host system.

=== Types of Emulation

* Full-System Emulation +
Replicates the entire hardware and software environment of the target system.
* Partial Emulation +
Focuses on emulating specific components or functionalities of the target system.
* Binary Translation +
Converts the target system's code into code that can be directly executed on the host system.
* Dynamic Recompilation +
Translate code on the fly as it's executed, optimizing performance.

=== Benefits

* Platform Independence +
Enable software to run on different hardware platforms.
* Legacy Support +
Preserve and extends the lifespan of older software and hardware.
* Testing and Development +
Provides a flexible environment for testing software on various platforms.
* Cost Effectiveness +
Reduces the need for physical hardware for testing and development.

=== Examples of Emulation

* QEMU +
A popular open-source emulator that supports a wide range of architectures.
* Bochs +
An open-source IA-32 (x86) PC emulator that can run various operating systems.
* VirtualBox +
A cross-platform virtualization software that allows users to run multiple operating systems on a single host.
