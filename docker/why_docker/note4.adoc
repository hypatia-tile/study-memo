= Walk through a concrete example that shows how code might fail on one environment but work correctly inside a Docker container

This will clearly show that "runs reliably across environments" really means.

== Scenario: App works in Docker, but fails on your machine

We'll use a Python app that requires a specific library version.

=== Works in Docker

==== Fails on host machin (if wrong wersion is installed)

Let's say we have a script that needs `requests==2.25.1`(an older version),
but your host has `requests==2.31.0`,
which behaves differently.

`app.py` -- a minimal example

[source, python]
----
#app.py
import requests

response = requsts.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
print(response.json()['headers']['Host']) # Only works with certain versions
----

==== Running this on your host:

[source, bash]
----
pip install requests # This installs the latest version
python app.py
----

Might raise:

[source, vbnet]
----
KeyError: 'Host'
----

Because in newer versions, the response format might have changed slightly.

[simple, text]
====
Actually, it might work on your machine, but not on someone else's.
====

==== Now, let's Dockerize it:

`requirements.txt`
[source, text]
----
requests==2.25.1
----

`Dockerfile`
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM python:3.11-slim

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
----

==== Build and run in Docker

[source, bash]
----
docker build -t reliable-app .
docker run reliable-app
----

Output:
[source, text]
----
httpbin.org
----

It works -- exactly as expected,
no matter where you run it.

== Why this works

Inside Docker:

* You control the Python version
* You install the exact library version
* You isolate from your system's Python environment

Outside Docker:

* System Python might be old/new
* Global `pip install` might interfere with other projects
* Subtle version change cause bugs
