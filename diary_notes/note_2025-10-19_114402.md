## Creating a virtual environment in Python with venv

Creating a Python project with a virtual environment involves a few key steps to ensure project isolation and dependency management.

## 1. Create Your Project Directory:

First, create a dedecated folder for your new Python project.
Navigate to this folder in your terminal or command prompt.

```bash
mkdir my_python_project
cd my_python_project
```

## 2. Create a Virtual Environment:

Python's built-in `venv` module is used to create virtual environments.
On macOS/Linux.
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

On Windows:
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

(Replace `venv` with your preferred name for the virtual environment folder if desired, though `venv` is a convention.)

## 3. Activate the Virtual Environment:

Activating the virtual environment ensures that any packages you install are specific to this project and don't interfere with your global Python installation on other projects.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

After activation,
your terminal prompt may change to indicate that the virtual environment is active.
You can now install packages using `pip`, and they will be contained within this environment.

```bash
soource venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

On PowerShell:
```bash
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

After activation, your terminal prompt will typically change to include the name of your
virtual environment (e.g., `(venv) my_python_project$`), indicating that it's active.

## 4. Install Project Dependencies:

With the virtual environment activated, you can now install any necessary libraries or packages for your project using `pip`.

```bash
pip install package_name_1 package_name_2
```

For example:
```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```
## 5. Develop Your Project:

You can now create your Python scripts and project file within the `my_python_project` directory.
When you run your scripts,
they will use the Python interpreter and packages from your activated virtual environment.

## 6. Deactivate the Virtual Environment(Optional):

When you're finished working on the project, you can deactivate the virtual environment.

```bash
deactivate
```

This returns you to your system's global Python environment.

## Summary:

By following these steps, you create an isolated environment for your Python project, preventing dependency conflicts and promoting a cleaner, more organized development workflow.
