## About `lspconfig` in Neovim

ref: https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig?tab=readme-ov-file#important-%EF%B8%8F

In Neovim version 0.11 and later, `lspconfig` is included as a built-in plugin; there's no need to install it separately.
### Important ⚠️: 

* `require 'lspconfig'` is deprecated in favor of `vim.lsp.config` (Nvim 0.11+).
  * The `lspconfig.lua` module will be dropped.
    Calls to `require 'lspconfig'` will show a warning, which will later become an error.
* `nvim-lspconfig` itself is *NOT deprecated*.
  It provides server-specific configs.
  * The configs live in the `lsp/` directory.
    `vim.lsp.conifg` automatically find them and merges them with any local `lsp/*.lua` config defined by you or a plugin.
  * The old configs in `lua/lspconfig/` are *deprecated* and will be removed.
