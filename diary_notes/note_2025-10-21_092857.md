## Zsh's `autoload` deyword

In `zsh`, functions are called in the same way as any other command.
There can be a name conflict between a program and a function.
What `autoload` does is to mark that name as being a function rather than an external program.
The function has to be in a file on its own, with same as the funcition name.

```zsh
autoload -Uz vcs_info
```

The `-U` means mark the function `vcs_info` for autoloading and suppress alias expansion.
The `-z` means use `zsh` (rather than `ksh`) style
See also [the function command.](https://zsh.sourceforge.io/Doc/Release/Functions.html)

So it records the fact that the name is a function and not an external program -- it does not call it unless the `-X` option is used, it just affects the search path when it is called.
If the function name does not collide with the name of a program the nit is not required.
Prefix your function with something like `f_` and you will probably never need it.
