## Python script for diary generation

My first work is creating a Python script that automatically generates my diary entries.

### Usage

Run the following command in the terminal:
```bash
python3 create_diary.py
```
This will create a new diary entry file with the current date.
If a file already exists for today, it will not overwrite it.
