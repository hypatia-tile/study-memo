### Devbox by jetify

The motivation to use Devbox is to create a isolated development environment for *Neovim* setting.
To know more about the benefits of using Devbox, you should also refer to [Introduction to Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox).
You should also refer to [Devbox GitHub repository](https://github.com/jetify/devbox).

### Installation

You can install Devbox by running the following command:
For macOS and Linux:
```bash
curl -fsSL https://get.jetify.dev | bash
```

### Getting started

This content is based on the official documentation of Devbox: [Create a Dev Environment with Devbox](https://www.jetify.com/docs/devbox/quickstart).

Anyway, you should be accustomed to operations provided in devbox.
Let's get started with the following command:

#### Create a development environment

We will create a new development environment with the packages we need.
These packages will only be available when using this Devbox shell, ensuring we do not pollute your machine.

**key commands to know**:
| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `devbox init` | Initializes a new Devbox project in the current directory, and creates a `devbox.json` file. |
| `devbox add <package-name>` | Adds a package to the Devbox project.
| `devbox shell` | Starts a new shell session with the Devbox environment activated. |

When you run `devbox search python3`, you will see the following output:
```bash
$ devbox search python3
Found 50+ results for "python3":

* python  (3.14.0rc3, 3.14.0rc1, 3.14.0b4, 3.14.0b3, 3.14.0b2, 3.14.0b1, 3.14.0a7, 3.14.0a6, 3.14.0a5, 3.14.0a4 ...)
* gnatcoll-python3  (24.0.0, 23.0.0, 22.0.0, 21.0.0)
* python310Packages.avro-python3  (1.10.2)
* python310Packages.mecab-python3  (1.0.8, 1.0.7, 1.0.6, 1.0.5, 1.0.4)
* python310Packages.python3-application  (3.0.6, 3.0.4, 3.0.3)
* python310Packages.python3-eventlib  (0.3.0)
* python310Packages.python3-gnutls  (3.1.9)
* python310Packages.python3-openid  (3.2.0)
* python310Packages.python3-saml  (1.15.0, 1.14.0, 1.12.0)
* python311Packages.avro-python3  (1.10.2)
```

If you want to install a specific version of a package, you can run `devbox add <package>@<version>`. For example, to install Python 3.10, you can run:
```bash
devbox add python@3.10
```
