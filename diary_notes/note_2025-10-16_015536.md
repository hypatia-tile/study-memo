## Python script for diary generation

My first work is writing a Python script which automatically generates my diary notes.

### Usage

Run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
python3 create_diary.py
```

This will create a new diary note named after the current date in format `note_YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.md`.

## How to check if the specified file exists in Python

In Python, checking if a file exists before attempting to use it is a common task,
especially if you are programmatically performing file operations like reading or writing data across a large number of files.

### Three Methods to Check If a File Exists in Python

* Prerequisites: Understand the current directory

Throughout this tutorial, I'll look at ways to verify whether the file `my_file.txt` will be stored in the folder `my_data`.
However, before doing that, it is essential to understand what your current folder structure looks like
so that you can navigate the directory effectively.
Here are a few standard function to help you navigate through your folder & directory.

1. Using the `os.path.exists()` function
2. Using the `pathlib.Path.exists()` function
3. Using the `try-except` block with file opening

## Next steps

* Add error handling for file creation.
* Customize the template for diary notes.
