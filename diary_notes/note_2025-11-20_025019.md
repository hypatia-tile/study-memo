## Change Caps Lock to `Ctrl`

* Reference
  * [Change Caps Lock to Ctrl](https://dev.to/tallesl/change-caps-lock-to-ctrl-3c4)
We frequently want to set the `Caps Lock` as `Ctrl`.
Concrete step is as follows:

### 1. Edit `/etc/default/keyboard`

For swapping the Caps Lock with Ctrl, Add the line:

```sh
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:swapcaps"
```

For just changing Caps Lock and not the Ctrl key (I prefer it):

```sh
XKBOPTIONS="ctrl:nocaps"
```

Finally, we apply this configuration:

```sh
sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration
```
