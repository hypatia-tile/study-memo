### Git in Zsh

Zsh also ships with a tab-completion library for Git.
To use it, simply run `autoload -Uz compinit && compinit`
in your `.zshrc`.
Zsh's interface is a bit more powerful than Bash's:

```zsh
$ git che<tab>
check-attr -- display gitattributes information
check-ref-format -- ensure that a reference name is well formed
checkout -- checkout branch or paths to working tree
checkout-index -- copy files from index to working directory
cherry -- find commits not merged upstream
cherry-pick -- apply changes introduced by some existing commits
```

Ambiguous tab-completions aren't just listed; they have helpful descriptions, and you can graphically navigate the list by repeatedly hitting tab.
This works with Git commands, their arguments, and names of things inside the repository (like refs and remotes), as well as filenames and all the other things Zsh knows how to tab-complete.
