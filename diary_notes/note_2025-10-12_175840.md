## Set environment for Haskell development in Neovim

I have been using Neovim as my main editor for Haskell development.

### Step1: Install `haskell-language-server` and `haskell-debug-adapter` using mason

### Step2: Install `haskell-tools.nvim`

[haskell-tools.nvim](https://github.com/mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim)
provides provides the lowest common denominator of LSP support.
This plugin is for those who would like additional features that are specific to Haskell tooling.

```lua
return {
  "mrcjkb/haskell-tools.nvim",
  version = "^6", -- Recommended
  lazy = false, -- This plugin is already lazy
}
```

### Local `Hoogle` installation

Install `Hoogle` locally to enable searching Haskell libraries from Neovim.
```bash
$ stack install hoogle
```
After installing `Hoogle`, run the following command to download the Hoogle database.
```bash
$ hoogle generate
```
And start the Hoogle server.
```bash
$ hoogle server --local
```

Then, add the following configuration to your Neovim setup.
```lua
require("mason").setup()
require("mason-lspconfig").setup({
  ensure_installed = { "hls" },
})
```
