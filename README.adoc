= Knowledge Manifest: My Study-Memo Workflow

This repository is a living system for capturing, structuring, and evolving my personal and technical knowledge. It is designed to be:

- **Tidy**: All notes are organized by topic in the `notes/` directory, with each topic as a single Asciidoc file.
- **Automated**: Scripts generate indexes and knowledge graphs, keeping everything discoverable and connected.
- **Extensible**: The structure and workflow are designed to grow with my learning needs.

== Workflow Principles

1. **Atomic Notes**: Each note or concept is captured in its relevant topic file, using clear sections and subsections.
2. **Consistent Structure**: All notes use Asciidoc, with a single top-level title per file and logical sectioning.
3. **Metadata & Linking**: Where useful, notes include metadata (tags, related topics) and cross-references to related knowledge.
4. **Automation**: Scripts in `scripts/` keep the index and knowledge graph up to date, and help detect structural issues.
5. **Review & Refactor**: Regularly review notes for clarity, deduplication, and improved structure.

== Directory Structure

- `notes/` — All knowledge, organized by topic (e.g., `docker.adoc`, `tex.adoc`, `c-language.adoc`, etc.)
- `scripts/` — Automation for indexing, graphing, and maintenance
- `index.adoc` — Auto-generated index of all notes
- `knowledge-graph.json` — Auto-generated knowledge graph for visualization and analysis

== How to Add Knowledge

1. **Find the right topic file** in `notes/` (or create a new one if needed).
2. **Add your note** as a new section or subsection, using Asciidoc headings.
3. **Link related concepts** using Asciidoc cross-references or explicit links.
4. **(Optional) Add metadata** at the top of the section if useful (e.g., tags, date).
5. **Run the automation scripts** to update the index and knowledge graph:

    [source, shell]
    ----
    python3 scripts/generate_index_and_knowledge_graph.py
    ----

== How to Add and Integrate Topic Notes (Modular Workflow)

1. **Work in the `draft/` directory**: Create a new topic folder in `draft/` (e.g., `draft/mytopic/`).
2. **Add a `main.adoc`** file and any other `.adoc` files in that folder. You can use the modular script:

    [source, shell]
    ----
    python3 scripts/note_manager.py draft draft/mytopic "Optional Title"
    ----

3. **Integrate all notes in the topic folder** into a single file in `notes/` with:

    [source, shell]
    ----
    python3 scripts/note_manager.py integrate draft/mytopic
    ----

   This will create (or overwrite) `notes/mytopic.adoc` with the integrated content.
4. **Review and edit the integrated file** for structure and clarity.
5. **Remove the original topic folder in `draft/`** if you want to keep things tidy.

== Draft Note Template

To quickly create a new draft note:

[source, shell]
----
python3 scripts/note_manager.py draft draft/mytopic "My Note Title"
----

This will create a timestamped `.adoc` file in the specified draft topic folder, with a title and metadata.

== Script Usage

- Create a draft note:
  [source, shell]
  ----
  python3 scripts/note_manager.py draft draft/mytopic "My Note Title"
  ----
- Integrate a topic:
  [source, shell]
  ----
  python3 scripts/note_manager.py integrate draft/mytopic
  ----

== How to Use the Note Manager (All-in-One Script)

The `note_manager.py` script now provides all note management features:

- **Create a draft note**
- **Integrate a topic**
- **Generate index and knowledge graph**
- **Detect multiple top-level titles**
- **Interactive menu for all features**

=== Example Usage

- Create a draft note:
  [source, shell]
  ----
  python3 scripts/note_manager.py draft draft/mytopic "My Note Title"
  ----
- Integrate a topic:
  [source, shell]
  ----
  python3 scripts/note_manager.py integrate draft/mytopic
  ----
- Interactive mode:
  [source, shell]
  ----
  python3 scripts/note_manager.py interactive
  ----

=== Advanced Features (to be run from the command line or added to interactive menu)

- Generate index and knowledge graph:
  [source, python]
  ----
  # Example (add to controller or run in Python REPL)
  notes_dir = 'notes'
  root_dir = '.'
  notes = NoteModel.find_notes(notes_dir)
  notes_meta = [NoteModel.extract_metadata(note, root_dir) for note in notes]
  NoteModel.generate_index(notes_meta, 'index.adoc')
  NoteModel.generate_knowledge_graph(notes_meta, 'knowledge-graph.json', abs_out_path='.knowledge-graph-abs.json', abs_paths=notes)
  ----
- Detect multiple top-level titles:
  [source, python]
  ----
  NoteModel.detect_multiple_titles('notes')
  ----

== Automation

- `generate_index_and_knowledge_graph.py`: Scans all notes, updates `index.adoc` and `knowledge-graph.json`.
- `integrate_notes.py`: (One-time) Integrates scattered notes into single topic files.
- `integrate_topic.py`: Integrates all notes in a topic folder into a single Asciidoc file.
- `detect_multiple_titles.py`: Detects and warns about multiple top-level titles in a file.

== Philosophy

- **Capture everything**: No idea is too small.
- **Refactor often**: Merge, split, and reorganize as understanding deepens.
- **Make connections**: Link related ideas to build a true knowledge graph.
- **Automate the boring parts**: Let scripts keep things tidy and discoverable.

== Next Steps

- Keep learning, keep capturing.
- Periodically run scripts to maintain structure.
- Visualize and explore your knowledge graph for new insights.
