= Knowledge Manifest: My Study-Memo Workflow

This repository is a living system for capturing, structuring, and evolving my personal and technical knowledge. It is designed to be:

- **Tidy**: All notes are organized by topic in the `notes/` directory, with each topic as a single Asciidoc file.
- **Automated**: Scripts generate indexes and knowledge graphs, keeping everything discoverable and connected.
- **Extensible**: The structure and workflow are designed to grow with my learning needs.

== Workflow Principles

1. **Atomic Notes**: Each note or concept is captured in its relevant topic file, using clear sections and subsections.
2. **Consistent Structure**: All notes use Asciidoc, with a single top-level title per file and logical sectioning.
3. **Metadata & Linking**: Where useful, notes include metadata (tags, related topics) and cross-references to related knowledge.
4. **Automation**: Scripts in `scripts/` keep the index and knowledge graph up to date, and help detect structural issues.
5. **Review & Refactor**: Regularly review notes for clarity, deduplication, and improved structure.

== Directory Structure

- `notes/` — All knowledge, organized by topic (e.g., `docker.adoc`, `tex.adoc`, `c-language.adoc`, etc.)
- `scripts/` — Automation for indexing, graphing, and maintenance
- `index.adoc` — Auto-generated index of all notes
- `knowledge-graph.json` — Auto-generated knowledge graph for visualization and analysis

== How to Add Knowledge

1. **Find the right topic file** in `notes/` (or create a new one if needed).
2. **Add your note** as a new section or subsection, using Asciidoc headings.
3. **Link related concepts** using Asciidoc cross-references or explicit links.
4. **(Optional) Add metadata** at the top of the section if useful (e.g., tags, date).
5. **Run the automation scripts** to update the index and knowledge graph:

    [source, shell]
    ----
    python3 scripts/generate_index_and_knowledge_graph.py
    ----

== How to Add and Integrate Topic Notes

1. **Create a new topic folder** in `notes/` (e.g., `notes/mytopic/`).
2. **Add a `main.adoc`** file and any other `.adoc` files in that folder.
3. **Integrate all notes in the topic folder** into a single file with:

    [source, shell]
    ----
    python3 scripts/integrate_topic.py notes/mytopic
    ----

   This will create (or overwrite) `notes/mytopic.adoc` with the integrated content.
4. **Review and edit the integrated file** for structure and clarity.
5. **Remove the original topic folder** if you want to keep the notes directory tidy.

== Automation

- `generate_index_and_knowledge_graph.py`: Scans all notes, updates `index.adoc` and `knowledge-graph.json`.
- `integrate_notes.py`: (One-time) Integrates scattered notes into single topic files.
- `integrate_topic.py`: Integrates all notes in a topic folder into a single Asciidoc file.
- `detect_multiple_titles.py`: Detects and warns about multiple top-level titles in a file.

== Philosophy

- **Capture everything**: No idea is too small.
- **Refactor often**: Merge, split, and reorganize as understanding deepens.
- **Make connections**: Link related ideas to build a true knowledge graph.
- **Automate the boring parts**: Let scripts keep things tidy and discoverable.

== Next Steps

- Keep learning, keep capturing.
- Periodically run scripts to maintain structure.
- Visualize and explore your knowledge graph for new insights.
